/** Takes a global metric map, an observation, and a SE(2) ROI, and evaluates
 * the likelihood of the observation in a regular SE(2) lattice.
 *
 * This is based on mrpt maps observationLikelihood() evaluation, so the main
 * parameters that determine the way likelihood is computed must be defined
 * on before hand within each of the metric map layers of the input reference
 * map.
 *
 * At present this algorithm is useful for these sensor/map types:
 * - observations: pointclouds/2d_scan, reference_map: 2D gridmap
 * - observations: pointclouds, reference_map: pointclouds
 *
 * \todo Implement likelihood of observations GNNS datum within georeferenced
 *       maps.
